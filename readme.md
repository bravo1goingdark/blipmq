# ðŸš€ BlipMQ â€” Lightweight, Durable, Single-Binary Message Broker

**BlipMQ** is an ultra-lightweight, fault-tolerant message queue written in Rust â€” designed for local-first, edge, and high-performance embedded systems. It offers **durability**, **per-subscriber isolation**, and **QoS-aware delivery**, all in a **single deployable binary**.

> Think: MQTT simplicity meets Kafka reliability â€” without the complexity.

## ðŸš¦ Ideal Use Cases

- Local-first apps needing embedded queues
- Edge devices or gateways (e.g. IoT ingestion)
- CI/CD pipelines that need a drop-in pub/sub layer
- Durable telemetry collectors in constrained environments
- Lightweight alternatives to Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS
