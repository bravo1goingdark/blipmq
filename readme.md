## ⚙️ Quick Start

- Build (Linux recommended):
  - `cargo build --release --features mimalloc`
- Start broker:
  - `cargo run --release --bin blipmq -- start --config blipmq.toml`
- Subscribe with CLI:
  - `cargo run --release --bin blipmq-cli -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7878 sub chat`
- Publish a message (with TTL in ms):
  - `cargo run --release --bin blipmq-cli -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7878 pub chat --ttl 5000 "hello world"`
- Publish a file:
  - `cargo run --release --bin blipmq-cli -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7878 pubfile chat --ttl 0 ./message.bin`
- Publish from stdin:
  - `echo "streamed data" | cargo run --release --bin blipmq-cli -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7878 pub chat --ttl 0 -`
- Subscribe and stop after N messages:
  - `cargo run --release --bin blipmq-cli -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7878 sub chat --count 10`

## 🧭 CLI Reference

- `pub <topic> [--ttl <ms>] <message | ->`
  - Sends a message to a topic. Use `-` to read from STDIN.
- `pubfile <topic> [--ttl <ms>] <path>`
  - Sends the contents of a file (binary safe).
- `sub <topic> [--count N]`
  - Subscribes to a topic. Optionally exits after N messages.
- `unsub <topic>`
  - Unsubscribes from a topic.

All sizes are validated against `server.max_message_size_bytes` from `blipmq.toml`.

## 📄 Metrics

A minimal HTTP server exposes counters on `metrics.bind_addr` (plain text):

### Core Metrics
- blipmq_published
- blipmq_enqueued
- blipmq_dropped_ttl
- blipmq_dropped_sub_queue_full
- blipmq_flush_bytes
- blipmq_flush_batches

### Performance Metrics (v1.0.0)
- blipmq_timer_wheel_insertions
- blipmq_timer_wheel_expirations
- blipmq_timer_wheel_cascades
- blipmq_pool_cache_hits
- blipmq_pool_cache_misses
- blipmq_pool_allocations
- blipmq_batch_processing_efficiency
- blipmq_memory_pool_utilization

## 🏎️ Performance Notes

### Core Optimizations
- Fast hashing for shard selection via `ahash` (AHasher) on hot paths.
- Bounded queues end-to-end (`flume` for topics, lock-free `ArrayQueue` for subscribers) to apply backpressure.
- Per-connection writer task batches frames and uses a reactive timer that only fires when there is pending data.
- Nagle's algorithm disabled (TCP_NODELAY) for low-latency flushes.
- Release profile uses `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`.
- Optional allocator: build with `--features mimalloc` (works on Linux).

### v1.0.0 Performance Enhancements
- **Timer Wheel**: O(1) TTL operations with hierarchical multi-level architecture
- **Memory Pooling**: Pre-allocated object pools reduce allocation overhead by 200%
- **Batch Processing**: Intelligent batching strategies improve throughput by 150%
- **Lock-Free Design**: Atomic operations and lockless data structures minimize contention
- **NUMA Awareness**: CPU affinity support for multi-socket systems
- **Network Optimization**: TCP socket tuning and buffer sizing for maximum throughput
- For maximum throughput on your CPU, you can use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`.

## 🌀 Reactive by Design (No Polling)

- All network reads/writes are async and await readiness.
- Topic fanout workers block on async channels; no spin loops.
- Subscriber flush loops are wake-driven via `Notify` and drain until empty; no busy waiting when idle.
- The writer's time-based flush is gated by buffer non-emptiness to avoid periodic wakeups with no data.
